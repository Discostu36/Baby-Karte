# Contribution guidelines

Thank you that you'd like to contribute to Babykarte. This set of guidelines is there to help you to understand our working process. 

## Issues
- If you'd like to report a bug, please give us as much information as possible:
  - What browser and OS are you using?
  - Is there a specific node on the map that you can link to as an example for the problem?
  - What are the steps to reproduce the problem?
- If you'd like to suggest a feature, please keep in mind that this map is mainly aimed at parents of babies and toddlers. New filters should contain POIs that are relevant for that age group. So e.g. no schools or youth centres

## Pull requests

- Before creating a pull request, please have a look at the issues. Maybe your idea has been discussed before.
- If you'd like to add features to the map (e.g. an additional filter), maybe it's a good idea to first create an issue so that we can discuss if the addition is really fitting to the project
- Please create pull requests against the `devel` branch, not `master`.
