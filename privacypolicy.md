## Third Parties we use
This website is located on GitHub Servers so that Babykarte can be reached with a browser. Because of that GitHub receives some data about our users e.g. IP-Address, operating system and which browser is in use. How GitHub threats collected data can be looked up in their [Privacy Policy](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement). 

When you use the searchfield to search for a place, Babykarte will send after the third char has been typed your search query to Komoot. Komoot enables searching around the globe and therefore powers the search. How Komoot threats the data it gets from the Babykarte can be read in their [Privacy Policy](https://www.komoot.de/privacy).

When you visit the Babykarte, your browser requests some data from foreign servers. These servers are cacheservers powered by two Companies. The first one is Google and  [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy#infocollect) you can find their privacy policy. The second one is DigitalOcean and has also its own [Privacy Policy](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/privacy-policy/). Your browser might send additionally data which could be used to identify you, Babykarte cannot control which data your browser additionally sends.

Babykarte uses data from the OpenStreetMap Community for displaying its map and other data like address, opening hours and other POI data. The OpenStreetMap Foundation hosts these datas on their own servers. Head over their [Privacy Policy]( https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy).

## Description of user data (Definition)
Babykarte doesn't collect user data, but it redirects it to third parties.

Below you will find a description of data third parties process and may store.

- (Public) IP Address
  -  The address of your router. The router gets its address from your internet provider. It's not the individual address of your computer, smartphone etc. The public IP address can be saved by the websites you visit.
  - Normally your internet provider provides you with a new IP address after 24 hours. Websites who saved your previous IP cannot identify you anymore by just relaying on your IP.
  - The router between your computer and the internet therefore acts as a firewall.
- Timestamp
  - Includes time and date.
  - Timestamps won't be sent by your browser. The website you visit adds them automatically.
- Browser
  - You use your browser to navigate the internet. For example navigating to OpenStreetMap, Komoot, GitHub, Google etc.
  - Name e.g. Firefox, Chrome or Safari. The version number counts too.
- Device type
  - Name of your device you use to navigate the internet.
  - Examples: Huawei p9 lite, Samsung S3 Mini
- Operating system's name.
  - The name of your operating system you use to navigate the internet.
  - Examples: Windows 10, Linux/Debian
- The site you came from (Referrer).
  - Internet address from which the requests to OSM Server, to komoot etc. are sent to. This will be always the internet address of Babykarte.

## Other Definitions

### Cacheserver
A Cacheserver saves files, which are often requested by browsers. This reduces loadtime. Website developers use Cacheserver as a storage for files which are often required for web programming and therefore also for users.

### Location of the user
Your browser asks you, if Babykarte should be given the permission to access your current location. If you aggree, the Babykarte will jump to your geographical position where your browser expects your location.
The accuracy of the detected location depends on the used location mechanism. If you don't aggree, the Babykarte will jump to a predefined position or to the address specified in the url.

When your browser doesn't ask you for permission to let Babykarte access your location then you might allowed to save your decision permanently.

The Babykarte doesn't request your location in the background, it requests it only when you visit Babykarte or when you reload it.

## Are these data sensible?
Not really. Most users have enabled their used apps to update automatically or it is a default behaviour.

- At least the most users use Windows 10 or Windows 7. So the name of the operating system equals to the majority.
- At least the most users use Safari, Chrome or Firefox. They also being hold up to date.
- Every network has its individual (public) IP address but normally your network gets a new one after 24 hours.
- Device type: Nobody uses a individual device type. For example many people have a Huawei p9 lite.

## Why are they being collected?
This may have some of the following reasons:

- To detect how many times a operating system is used, which browser is being used.
- To solve problems with some browsers and or operating systems.
- To have the possibility to trace back your IP address by an authority in cases a user - hopefully not you - attacked the provider.
- To find out what the user might like or dislike. Usually big companies do that but they depend on a variety of data.

## How can I prevent data collection?
You can't or at least just with opt out functions. But you're in the position of faking data or to hide your identity.

- Using the TOR Browser.
- Modern browsers provide you with a way to have all saved information on your computer deleted after closing it. Refer to your browser's user manual for more information about it and how to activate this function.
